Rastajax
========

IMPORTANT: This project is in its early stages of evolution. There are currently NO releases available, just the source code. As soon as I have a first release ready I'll get it pushed to Maven Central. Keep your eyes on [issue #1](https://github.com/kelveden/rastajax/issues/1) for an indication of when this is done.

A lightweight library for dynamically generating descriptions REST APIs.

Key features:

* Standards compliant. Generation of descriptions is based entirely on the annotations from the [JAX-RS 1.1 Specification](http://jsr311.java.net/) plus a single custom annotation.
* Completely independent of any JAX-RS implementation.
* Lightweight. Dependencies both direct and transitive are kept to a minimum.
